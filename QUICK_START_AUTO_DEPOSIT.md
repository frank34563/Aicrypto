3. **Fallback Mechanism**: If auto-confirmation fails, falls back to manual approval
4. **Audit Trail**: All deposits are logged with complete transaction details
5. **Toggle Control**: Feature can be disabled anytime to revert to manual approval

## Supported Networks

## Common Questions

**Q: What happens to deposits during the transition?**
A: All existing deposits continue to work. The feature only affects new deposits after enablement.

**Q: Can I disable the feature?**
A: Yes! Use `/disable_auto_deposit` to revert to manual approval at any time.

**Q: Are the addresses secure?**
A: Yes! They're generated using cryptographic hashing (SHA256) and are deterministic and unique.

**Q: What if blockchain verification fails?**
A: The system has fallback mechanisms. If auto-confirmation fails, it falls back to manual admin approval.

**Q: Can users have multiple addresses?**
A: Yes! Each user can have one address per coin/network combination.

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: The current implementation simulates blockchain verification. For production, integrate with real blockchain APIs (see AUTO_DEPOSIT_FEATURE.md for integration guides).

## Production Deployment

For production use with real blockchain verification, see:
- `AUTO_DEPOSIT_FEATURE.md` - Complete technical documentation
- Section: "Production Deployment" - Integration guides for:
  - TronGrid API (TRC20)
  - Bitcoin blockchain APIs
  - Solana web3.js
  - HD wallet derivation
  - Wallet service APIs (BitGo, Fireblocks)
